The `{}`, or "empty object" type in TypeScript is a common source of confusion for developers unfamiliar with TypeScript's structural typing.
`{}` represents any _non-nullish value_, including literals like `0` and `""`:

```ts
let anyNonNullishValue: {} = 'Intentionally allowed by TypeScript.';
```

Often, developers writing `{}` actually mean either:

- `object`: representing any _object_ value
- `unknown`: representing any value _other than `null` and `undefined`_

To avoid confusion around the `{}` type allowing non-object values, this rule bans usage of the `{}` type.

:::tip
If you do have a use case for an API allowing any _non-nullish value_, you can always use an [ESLint disable comment](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) or [disable the rule in your ESLint config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-files-1).

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
let anyObject: {};
let anyValue: {};
let emptyObject: {};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
let anyObject: object;
let anyValue: unknown;
let emptyObject: Record<string, never>;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## When Not To Use It

If your code commonly needs to represent the _"any non-nullish value"_ type, this rule may not be for you.
Projects that extensively use type operations such as conditional types and mapped types oftentimes benefit from disabling this rule.
